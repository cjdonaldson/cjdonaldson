      Hired to work on a new product offering to provide easier access - a gateway - to the powerful analytics available
      in the 1010data database engine.
      This new user tool provided spreadsheet and graphical views as incremental processing steps are applied to ingest,
      transform, and analyze their data.
      I provided an end-point to upload multi-gigabyte files via a chunking process and injected per the 1010data
      database API.
      Integration of this process identified database API restrictions which lead to implementing an AWS S3 chunks and
      aggregations process where the database was able to injest from an S3 key.
      Implemented additional services to support the communication, validation, aggregation and interfacing between UI,
      service databases and the 1010data engine.
